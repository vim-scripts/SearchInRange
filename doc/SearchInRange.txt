DESCRIPTION				       *SearchInRange-description*

Vim can limit the scope of searches to the remainder of the buffer with the
'wrapscan' option, but it cannot limit searches to a particular range, other
than by including special regular expression atoms like |/\%l|. It's not easy
to restrict a search to the current function, or next 100 lines, even though
such is often useful to avoid getting lost in the buffer.

This plugin provides custom search motions, similar to the built-in |n| / |N|,
which only move to matches of the current search pattern that fall within a
certain range that has been specified through the |:SearchInRange| command, or
an equivalent mapping.

RELATED WORKS								     *

- range-search (vimscript #1396) defines a :R command.
- vis.vim (vimscript #1195) defines a :S command and // and ?? mappings. It
  works by modifying the search pattern to add restrictions for lines and
  columns.

==============================================================================
USAGE						     *SearchInRange-usage*
							      *:SearchInRange*
:[range]SearchInRange 	Search forward to the first occurrence of the current
			search pattern inside [range]. Limit search to lines
			inside [range] when jumping to the next search result.
:[range]SearchInRange [/]{pattern}[/]
			Search for {pattern}, starting with the first
			occurrence inside [range]. Limit search to lines
			inside [range] when jumping to the next search result.
			Without [/], only literal whole words are matched.
			|:search-args|
								 *v_<Leader>/*
{Visual}<Leader>/	Jump to the first occurrence of the last search
			pattern inside selection. Limit search to lines inside
			selection when jumping to the next search result.
								   *<Leader>/*
<Leader>/{motion}	Use the moved-over lines as a range to limit searches
			to. Jump to first occurrence of the last search
			pattern inside the range.


The special searches all start with 'go...' (mnemonic: "go once to special
match"); and come in search forward (ending with lowercase letter) and search
backward (uppercase letter) variants.
								   *gor* *goR*
[count]gor / goR	Search forward / backward to the [count]'th occurrence
			of the last search pattern in the previously specified
			range.

INSTALLATION				      *SearchInRange-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchInRange*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				      *SearchInRange-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |ingo-library.vim| plugin (vimscript #4433), version 1.020 or
  higher.
- SearchRepeat.vim (vimscript #4949) plugin (optional)

==============================================================================
INTEGRATION				       *SearchInRange-integration*

If the SearchRepeat plugin is installed, a parallel set of "go now and for
next searches" mappings (starting with 'gn...' instead of 'go...') is
installed. These mappings have the same effect, but in addition re-program the
'n/N' keys to repeat this particular search (until another gn... search is
used).
